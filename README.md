A simple Electron app to come as close as possible to providing a Linux desktop app for [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/).

This app is equipped with all the wonderful features of an electron app, including Dark theme (from Gtk light/dark), media playback, and Dev Tools (`Ctl+Shift+I`). Please enjoy.

## Development
1. Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/Spiffily/libby-desktop && cd libby-desktop`
2. Install npm. `sudo apt-get install -y npm` on Ubuntu based OSes
3. Install latest electron. `npm install --save-dev electron`
4. Run the app. `npm start`

## Credits
The Libby icon was taken from this page for use as the app icon: https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/

**Disclaimer: Libby is in no way, shape, or form the work of Spiffily Software. This app is only a simple electron package to allow you to read in a sort of desktop app.**
